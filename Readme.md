# A simple Logger with focus on Reinforcement Learning Projects

Almost surely some of this is inspired by some code I've seen on GitHub. I will
update the file with the credits as soon as I remember the source.

# Installation

This should do it:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/floringogianu/rl_logger.git
```


## To Do

- [ ] Integrate `tensorboardX`.
- [ ] Clean-up the code. I wrote it a while ago and some of it is nasty.
- [ ] Continue work on test coverage.
- [ ] Check for performance issues.
